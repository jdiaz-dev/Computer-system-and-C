//AllocateSufficientStorage method: review was_allocated, create a T* buf_ with char, check Realloc method, check memcpy of sqlite3
//debug where is pwd AllocateSufficientStorage , SetLengthAndZeroTerminate methods
//execute test.js file to check how it is received options in c++ side, chck how to works pipes in Node.js, realize test with child_process
//review the process to AllocateSufficientStorage and SetLengthAndZeroTerminate again
